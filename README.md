# Hey, I'm Marcelo! 👋 🙋 🇵🇪

Hey, I'm Kristen! 👋
I'm an incoming software engineer at Apple on the Siri Client team. I recently graduated from the University of British Columbia, where I studied Computer Science. I like learning and building stuff related to operating systems and compilers!

Previously...
I interned at Apple twice before my full-time role.
I co-founded UBC Local Hack Day, which has since become a part of nwPlus.
I have been a Teaching Assistant for CPSC 110: Computation, Programs, and Programming and 304: Introduction to Relational Databases at UBC.
In my free time
I make websites and do web design for fun.
I paint and draw sometimes.
I enjoy playing video games. Recently, I've been playing a lot of League of Legends, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Teamfight Tactics.
